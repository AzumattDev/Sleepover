# Description

## Remake of Sleepover, with minimal changes.

`Client Only mod` - This mod is a remake of the original Sleepover mod by kinghfb. I have made minimal changes to the mod, and I will be maintaining it from now on until a kind soul takes it from me.
I used my modding template to remake the mod so that it is easier to maintain and update in the future. Just took patches from the original mod and applied them to my template.
